        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These spicy Lime Shrimp Dragon Noodles are a fast, easy, and inexpensive alternative to take out. This version features tender shrimp and fresh lime.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 lb frozen peeled & deveined shrimp (51/70 size)</li>
                <li>2 packs (3 oz. each) ramen noodles</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp sriracha</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 lime</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2 green onions</li>
                <li>Handful fresh cilantro</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the shrimp in a colander and rinse with cool water until thawed. Let the shrimp drain until ready to use.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl stir together the sriracha, soy sauce, brown sugar, and about 1 Tbsp juice from the lime. Set the sauce aside.</li>
                <li>Fill a medium sauce pot with water, place a lid on top, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ramen noodles (without the flavoring packet) and continue to boil until the noodles are tender. Drain the noodles in a colander (if using the same colander for the shrimp, make sure to wash it with soap and water first).</li>
                <li>While waiting for the water to boil, mince two cloves of garlic. Add the butter and garlic to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat until the garlic is soft (about one minute). Add the shrimp and continue to sauté until the shrimp turn pink and opaque (about 3-5 minutes). Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
                <li>Once the noodles have drained, add them to the skillet with the shrimp, then pour the prepared sauce over top. Toss the noodles in the sauce until everything is coated in sauce. Top the dragon noodles with sliced green onion, fresh cilantro leaves, and a squeeze of lime.</li>
            </ol>
